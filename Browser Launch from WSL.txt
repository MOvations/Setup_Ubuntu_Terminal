if you want to auto-launch jupyter, and not have to copy-paste the link from the terminal (and rename to 127.0.0.1 to LocalHost every time)
add your browser path to your browser executable in Windows

Something like:
export BROWSER='/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe'
or
export BROWSER='/mnt/c/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe'


Which also requires that your generate a config file for jupyter

jupyter lab --generate-config

Navigate to the file in 
~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py

and uncomment
c.NotebookApp.use_redirect_file = False




Let's try adding this to the bash script

export BROWSER='/mnt/c/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe'
jupyter lab --generate-config
sed -i '/c.NotebookApp.use_redirect_file/s/^#//g' ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
sed -i 's|c.NotebookApp.use_redirect_file = True|c.NotebookApp.use_redirect_file = False|' ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
