## Setup Windows Terminal in WSL2 on Ubuntu (18.04/20.04)

Motivation:
    I really dislike setting up  environments, and I do it a lot. So I'm taking the time to make an install to get things the way I like.

You will have to get WSL2 installed as well as an ubuntu distro installed first (tested this on 20.04/18.04 for now) from the microsoft store, you will also have to install windows terminal from the microsoft store as well.

    and

    for getting me setup with some great settings!

Note:
I implement 2 terminal settings (bash and zsh) as vscode and Windows Terminal will behave differently
