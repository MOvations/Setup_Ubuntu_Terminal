# Setup Terminal in Ubuntu (18.04/20.04) with support for WSL2 and Ubuntu Server

## Motivation: <br>
I dislike setting up environments, so I'm automating it to speed up deployments. I'll be trying to incorporate as many of my settingas as I like for all the linux environments I use.</br>

## Quickstart: Run and Done 
Setup WSL2 for your Windows 10 pro system and isntall an Ubuntu distro from the Microsoft store. 
(Note: I've tested this on 20.04/18.04 so far)
I also use the new Microsoft Terminal, which you also install from the micro soft store

It's still a bit quirky (sorry) sometime it installs in one pass, sometimes it only gets upto the 'git' portion
if this happens rerun the setup script

and
[Fireship.io](https://fireship.io/lessons/windows-10-for-web-dev/)
for getting me setup with some great settings!

## Final Notes:

I left settings for bashrc (commented out) in the setup script if you'd like to have different look in an editor (e.g., VScode) vs Terminal
