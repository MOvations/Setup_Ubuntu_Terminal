## Setup Windows Terminal in WSL2 on Ubuntu (18.04/20.04)

Motivation:
    I hate setting up  environments, so I'm taking the time to make an install to get things the way I like.

Have to get WSL2 installed and ubuntu installed first (testing this on 20.04/18.04 for now), and windows terminal.

Thanks to:


Note:
I implement 2 terminal settings (bash and zsh) vscode and winterm will run differently
